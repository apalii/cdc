cdc
===

Duration calls checker - it is a simple script which allows to check some call with long duration.
Script takes two parameters :
1) IP address of the needed sip environment
2) Max allowed duration of the call

In case when call duration exceeds the entered value - script will show the call-id of this call.
It possible to use cdc.py without parameters in order to see list of the ip addresses of the available sip envs
on the current sip server.
